## Era IV Preview | Land Clearing Strategy Share, Clear Land Easily with Low Losses
translated from: https://www.bilibili.com/opus/1002658818215116808

World of启元 Mobile Game November 22, 2024, 23:08

Hello, Trailblazers! The first batch of Era IV servers for "World of启元" is about to launch. To help more players understand how to approach land clearing in Era IV, we have invited a community strategy group to share their insights for the new era.

### Recommended Land Clearing Teams

Wei Qing, Qin Shi Huang, and Pericles are still the T0 land clearing team. New heroes can form several T1 teams. Since everyone is already in Era IV, we will skip the fundamental principles and go straight to team tier recommendations. Overall, there isn't much change from previous land clearing teams. It is recommended to use tanky teams or teams with extreme burst damage + control (the Qin Shi Huang system). Teams with higher damage output will have a higher ceiling and lower battle losses. Note for the images below: All heroes are assumed to be at level 10 with their first row of skills unlocked. Teams that cannot be used before level 20 are marked.

---

#### T0 Teams:

##### Team 1: Wei/Qin/Co (Available from Level 1)

| Category    | Wei Qing                | Qin Shi Huang              | Columbus                  |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Hero**    | 卫青 (Wei Qing)           | 秦始皇 (Qin Shi Huang)        | 哥伦布 (Columbus)            |
| **Skill 1** | 淬毒飞刀 (Poisoned Dagger)¹ | 决水千仞 (Breaching Flood)²    | 制敌机先 (Preemptive Strike)³ |
| **Skill 2** | 加冕 (Coronation)         | 动于九天 (Celestial Maneuver)⁴ | 巧舌如簧 (Silver Tongue)⁵     |

> [!NOTE] **Translation Notes:**
> ¹ [淬毒飞刀/Cuìdú Fēidāo] Lit. "Poison-quenched Flying Dagger." 
> ² [决水千仞/Juéshuǐ Qiānrèn] An idiom referring to breaking a dike and releasing a flood of immense depth/force. 
> ³ [制敌机先/Zhìdí Jīxiān] An idiom meaning "to gain the upper hand by striking first." 
> ⁴ [动于九天/Dòng yú Jiǔtiān] An idiom from Sun Tzu's Art of War, describing movement so swift and unpredictable it is as if occurring "above the highest heavens." 
> ⁵ [巧舌如簧/Qiǎoshé Rúhuáng] An idiom describing a glib or eloquent tongue, like a musical reed instrument.

**Comment:** A newly promoted T0 team. It relies on Wei Qing to stack buffs for Columbus. Although its sustain is not as good as the Pericles variant, its damage is higher and the burst is faster.

##### Team 2: Wei/Qin/Pe (Available from Level 1)

![SS4 Server จีน - Era IV Preview - Land Clearing Strategy Share, Clear Land Easily with Low Losses-1756009580818.webp](/img/user/_attachments/SS4%20Server%20%E0%B8%88%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%99%20-%20Era%20IV%20Preview%20-%20Land%20Clearing%20Strategy%20Share,%20Clear%20Land%20Easily%20with%20Low%20Losses-1756009580818.webp)

| Category    | Wei Qing                | Qin Shi Huang              | Pericles                  |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Hero**    | 卫青 (Wei Qing)           | 秦始皇 (Qin Shi Huang)        | 伯里克利 (Pericles)           |
| **Skill 1** | 淬毒飞刀 (Poisoned Dagger)¹ | 决水千仞 (Breaching Flood)²    | 制敌机先 (Preemptive Strike)³ |
| **Skill 2** | 加冕 (Coronation)         | 动于九天 (Celestial Maneuver)⁴ | 巧舌如簧 (Silver Tongue)⁵     |

> [!NOTE] **Translation Notes:** 
> ¹ [淬毒飞刀/Cuìdú Fēidāo] Lit. "Poison-quenched Flying Dagger." 
> ² [决水千仞/Juéshuǐ Qiānrèn] An idiom referring to breaking a dike and releasing a flood of immense depth/force. 
> ³ [制敌机先/Zhìdí Jīxiān] An idiom meaning "to gain the upper hand by striking first." 
> ⁴ [动于九天/Dòng yú Jiǔtiān] An idiom from Sun Tzu's Art of War, describing movement so swift and unpredictable it is as if occurring "above the highest heavens." 
> ⁵ [巧舌如簧/Qiǎoshé Rúhuáng] An idiom describing a glib or eloquent tongue, like a musical reed instrument.

**Comment:** Still T0. This team has the lowest battle losses. When clearing high-level land quickly, such as level 10 land (at hero level 40+), you can swap Pericles for Cao Cao for more stable damage output that isn't afraid of the [Suppression]¹ effect.

---

#### T1 Teams:

##### Team 3: Oath of the Peach Garden (Only available after Level 20)

![SS4 Server จีน - Era IV Preview - Land Clearing Strategy Share, Clear Land Easily with Low Losses-1756010588667.webp](/img/user/_attachments/SS4%20Server%20%E0%B8%88%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%99%20-%20Era%20IV%20Preview%20-%20Land%20Clearing%20Strategy%20Share,%20Clear%20Land%20Easily%20with%20Low%20Losses-1756010588667.webp)

| Category    | Guan Yu                     | Liu Bei                             | Zhang Fei                       |
| ----------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Hero**    | 关羽 (Guan Yu)                | 刘备 (Liu Bei)                        | 张飞 (Zhang Fei)                  |
| **Skill 1** | 战无不克 (Invincible)¹          | 避实/全境 (Avoid the Solid / Aegis)²    | 绝地反击 (Desperate Counterattack)³ |
| **Skill 2** | 损敌利己 (Self-Serving Strike)⁴ | 整军/王者 (Rally Troops / Kingly Aura)⁵ | 镇卫护军 (Garrison Guard)           |

> [!NOTE] **Translation Notes:** 
> ¹ [战无不克/Zhàn Wú Bù Kè] An idiom meaning "to be victorious in every battle." ² [避实/Bì Shí] From the idiom "avoid the enemy's strength and strike their weakness." [全境/Quán Jìng] Lit. "Entire Territory," likely implying an area-wide defensive skill. ³ [绝地反击/Juédì Fǎnjī] An idiom for "counter-attacking from a hopeless or desperate situation." ⁴ [损敌利己/Sǔn Dí Lì Jǐ] An idiom meaning "to harm the enemy for one's own benefit." ⁵ [整军/Zhěng Jūn] Lit. "To reorganize the army," likely a healing or recovery skill. [王者/Wáng Zhě] Lit. "King," likely a buff representing a king's presence.

**Comment:** The old "Peach Garden"² team is still considered T1. It's a relatively effective tanky team, slightly slower and with slightly higher losses than the Wei/Qin/Pericles team. If your Guan Yu has high duplicates³, you can opt for a magic-based build.

##### Team 4: Gil/Qin/Sal (Available from Level 1)

![SS4 Server จีน - Era IV Preview - Land Clearing Strategy Share, Clear Land Easily with Low Losses-1756010926878.webp](/img/user/_attachments/SS4%20Server%20%E0%B8%88%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%99%20-%20Era%20IV%20Preview%20-%20Land%20Clearing%20Strategy%20Share,%20Clear%20Land%20Easily%20with%20Low%20Losses-1756010926878.webp)

| Category    | Gilgamesh                | Qin Shi Huang              | Saladin                   |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Hero**    | 吉尔伽美什 (Gilgamesh)        | 秦始皇 (Qin Shi Huang)        | 萨拉丁 (Saladin)             |
| **Skill 1** | 神圣加冕 (Sacred Coronation) | 决水千仞 (Breaching Flood)²    | 制敌机先 (Preemptive Strike)³ |
| **Skill 2** | 天下将倾 (World's Collapse)⁴ | 动于九天 (Celestial Maneuver)⁵ | 回马枪 (Parting Shot)⁶       |

> [!NOTE] **Translation Notes:**
> ¹ The team name in the image, 吉萨帝 (Jí Sà Dì), is a community shorthand. Based on the heroes present, it likely stands for **Gi**lgamesh, **Sa**ladin, and Emperor **Di** (referring to Qin Shi Huang). ² [决水千仞/Juéshuǐ Qiānrèn] An idiom referring to breaking a dike and releasing a flood of immense depth/force. ³ [制敌机先/Zhìdí Jīxiān] An idiom meaning "to gain the upper hand by striking first." ⁴ [天下将倾/Tiānxià Jiāng Qīng] Lit. "The world is about to fall," implying a cataclysmic attack. ⁵ [动于九天/Dòng yú Jiǔtiān] An idiom from Sun Tzu's Art of War, describing movement so swift and unpredictable it is as if occurring "above the highest heavens." ⁶ [回马枪/Huímǎqiāng] An idiom for a surprise attack delivered while turning back, as if in retreat.

**Comment:** The go-to brain-dead land clearing team from the first Era. Note that the skill [Parting Shot]⁴ can conflict with Gilgamesh's [Epic of Heroes]. This team can be used from level 1 all the way past level 20. It remains very strong after level 20, and while not as good as some other teams this version, it's still a solid choice.

##### Team 5: Talents of Jiangdong (Available from Level 1)

![SS4 Server จีน - Era IV Preview - Land Clearing Strategy Share, Clear Land Easily with Low Losses-1756011097644.webp](/img/user/_attachments/SS4%20Server%20%E0%B8%88%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%99%20-%20Era%20IV%20Preview%20-%20Land%20Clearing%20Strategy%20Share,%20Clear%20Land%20Easily%20with%20Low%20Losses-1756011097644.webp)

| Category    | Lu Xun                      | Zhou Yu                    | Lu Su                                    |
| ----------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Hero**    | 陆逊 (Lu Xun)                 | 周瑜 (Zhou Yu)               | 鲁肃 (Lu Su)                               |
| **Skill 1** | 阳焰 (Solar Flare)            | 整军经武 (Military Readiness)¹ | 迁延战术 (Delaying Tactics)                  |
| **Skill 2** | 百炼千锤 (Thoroughly Tempered)² | 神机妙算 (Divine Stratagem)³   | 避实击虚 (Avoid the Solid, Strike the Void)⁴ |

> [!NOTE] **Translation Notes:** 
> ¹ [整军经武/Zhěng Jūn Jīng Wǔ] An idiom for organizing troops and managing military affairs, essentially preparing for war. ² [百炼千锤/Bǎi Liàn Qiān Chuí] An idiom meaning "a hundred refinements and a thousand hammerings," used to describe something that has been steeled or rigorously tempered. ³ [神机妙算/Shénjī Miàosuàn] An idiom describing a wonderfully clever plan or divine calculation; a brilliant stratagem. ⁴ [避实击虚/Bì Shí Jī Xū] A tactical idiom meaning to evade the enemy's strengths and attack their weaknesses.

**Comment:** The Eastern Wu "Dudu"⁵ team. The overall land clearing experience is similar to the Peach Garden team. It's quite stable for clearing level 8 land at level 30 with the troop bonus. After level 40 with titles and high troop counts, it is also very stable for clearing level 9-10 land, second only to Wei/Qin/Pericles. It can clear level 6 land under-leveled before level 20.

##### Team 6: Columbus Focus Fire Team (Available from Level 20)

![SS4 Server จีน - Era IV Preview - Land Clearing Strategy Share, Clear Land Easily with Low Losses-1756011282524.webp](/img/user/_attachments/SS4%20Server%20%E0%B8%88%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%99%20-%20Era%20IV%20Preview%20-%20Land%20Clearing%20Strategy%20Share,%20Clear%20Land%20Easily%20with%20Low%20Losses-1756011282524.webp)

| Category    | Columbus                      | Qin Shi Huang              | Isabella I                  |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Hero**    | 哥伦布 (Columbus)                | 秦始皇 (Qin Shi Huang)        | 伊莎贝拉一世 (Isabella I)         |
| **Skill 1** | 悬权而动 (Calculated Move)¹       | 决水千仞 (Breaching Flood)²    | 加冕 (Coronation)             |
| **Skill 2** | 诛心之论 (Heart-Piercing Rebuke)³ | 动于九天 (Celestial Maneuver)⁴ | 以战养战 (Sustain through War)⁵ |

> [!NOTE] **Translation Notes:**
>  ¹ [悬权而动/Xuán Quán Ér Dòng] An idiom that means to weigh the situation and then act accordingly. ² [决水千仞/Juéshuǐ Qiānrèn] An idiom referring to breaking a dike and releasing a flood of immense depth/force. ³ [诛心之论/Zhū Xīn Zhī Lùn] An idiom for an argument that attacks one's intentions or motives rather than their actions. ⁴ [动于九天/Dòng yú Jiǔtiān] An idiom from Sun Tzu's Art of War, describing movement so swift and unpredictable it is as if occurring "above the highest heavens." ⁵ [以战养战/Yǐ Zhàn Yǎng Zhàn] A strategic idiom meaning "to use war to sustain war," often implying a lifesteal or resource-draining effect in games.

**Comment:** A focus-fire team built around Columbus. Its strength is considerable, with a land clearing experience similar to the Peach Garden and Gilgamesh/Caesar/Alexander teams. It is an extreme damage output team. While it is stable for clearing level 9 land after level 40 with titles, it falls short against level 10 land compared to the Wei Qing variant.

#### T2 Teams:

##### Team 7: Expanding Frontiers 

![SS4 Server จีน - Era IV Preview - Land Clearing Strategy Share, Clear Land Easily with Low Losses-1756011419476.webp](/img/user/_attachments/SS4%20Server%20%E0%B8%88%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%99%20-%20Era%20IV%20Preview%20-%20Land%20Clearing%20Strategy%20Share,%20Clear%20Land%20Easily%20with%20Low%20Losses-1756011419476.webp)

| Category    | Alexander             | Liu Bei                 | Sun Tzu                         |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Hero**    | 亚历山大 (Alexander)      | 刘备 (Liu Bei)            | 孙武 (Sun Tzu)                    |
| **Skill 1** | 战无不克 (Invincible)¹    | 迁延战术 (Delaying Tactics) | 绝地反击 (Desperate Counterattack)² |
| **Skill 2** | 箭雨流星 (Meteor Arrows)³ | 王者崛起 (King's Rise)      | 镇卫护军 (Garrison Guard)           |

> [!NOTE] **Translation Notes:**
> ¹ [战无不克/Zhàn Wú Bù Kè] An idiom meaning "to be victorious in every battle." ² [绝地反击/Juédì Fǎnjī] An idiom for "counter-attacking from a hopeless or desperate situation." ³ [箭雨流星/Jiàn Yǔ Liúxīng] Lit. "Arrow Rain, Flowing Stars," suggesting a shower of arrows as swift and dense as a meteor shower.

**Comment:** A fate-based land clearing team. The evasion can stack, making it incredibly tanky. It's very comfortable to use from level 1 to 20. After level 20, its strength is not on par with T1 and T0 teams.

##### Team 8: Military Masters (Available from Lvl 1)

![SS4 Server จีน - Era IV Preview - Land Clearing Strategy Share, Clear Land Easily with Low Losses-1756012081021.webp](/img/user/_attachments/SS4%20Server%20%E0%B8%88%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%99%20-%20Era%20IV%20Preview%20-%20Land%20Clearing%20Strategy%20Share,%20Clear%20Land%20Easily%20with%20Low%20Losses-1756012081021.webp)

| Category    | Alexander                   | Sun Tzu                             | Pericles                               |
| ----------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Hero**    | 亚历山大 (Alexander)            | 孙武 (Sun Tzu)                        | 伯里克利 (Pericles)                        |

| **Skill 2** | 损敌利己 (Self-Serving Strike)³ | 王者/整军 (Kingly Aura / Rally Troops)⁴ | 镇卫护军/寒光 (Garrison Guard / Cold Light)⁵ |

> [!NOTE] **Translation Notes:**
> ¹ [战无不克/Zhàn Wú Bù Kè] An idiom meaning "to be victorious in every battle." ² [绝地反击/Juédì Fǎnjī] An idiom for "counter-attacking from a hopeless or desperate situation." ³ [损敌利己/Sǔn Dí Lì Jǐ] An idiom meaning "to harm the enemy for one's own benefit." ⁴ [王者/Wáng Zhě] Lit. "King," likely a buff representing a king's presence. [整军/Zhěng Jūn] Lit. "To reorganize the army," likely a healing or recovery skill. ⁵ [镇卫护军/Zhèn Wèi Hù Jūn] Lit. "Garrison to protect the army." [寒光/Hán Guāng] Lit. "Cold Light," often used to describe the chilling glint of a blade.

**Comment:** A skill-chaining mechanic land clearing team, where skills trigger each other repeatedly. Caesar can replace either Pericles or Sun Wu, slightly increasing the team's strength.

##### Team 9: Counterattack Gramps (Available from Lvl 1)¹

![SS4 Server จีน - Era IV Preview - Land Clearing Strategy Share, Clear Land Easily with Low Losses-1756012213189.webp](/img/user/_attachments/SS4%20Server%20%E0%B8%88%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%99%20-%20Era%20IV%20Preview%20-%20Land%20Clearing%20Strategy%20Share,%20Clear%20Land%20Easily%20with%20Low%20Losses-1756012213189.webp)

| Category    | Pericles                           | Sun Tzu                                  | Zhang Fei / Antony              |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Hero**    | 伯里克利 (Pericles)                    | 孙武 (Sun Tzu)                             | 张飞/安东尼 (Zhang Fei / Antony)     |

| **Skill 2** | 战无/万夫 (Invincible / Unstoppable)⁴  | 王者/整军 (Kingly Aura / Rally Troops)⁵      | 镇卫护军 (Garrison Guard)           |

> [!NOTE] **Translation Notes:** 
> ¹ [反击爷爷/Fǎnjī Yéyé] A community nickname, literally "Counterattack Grandpa," likely referring to a veteran team composition focused on counterattacks. ² [避实击虚/Bì Shí Jī Xū] A tactical idiom meaning to evade the enemy's strengths and attack their weaknesses. ³ [绝地反击/Juédì Fǎnjī] An idiom for "counter-attacking from a hopeless or desperate situation." ⁴ [战无/万夫] This appears to be a shorthand for two different skills: 战无不克 (Invincible) and 万夫莫当 (Unstoppable against ten thousand foes). ⁵ [王者/Wáng Zhě] Lit. "King," likely a buff representing a king's presence. [整军/Zhěng Jūn] Lit. "To reorganize the army," likely a healing or recovery skill.

**Comment:** A new way to use Pericles after his update. Pair him with Zhang Fei or Antony for a triple-core output. The center-rank can also be Caesar or Cleopatra. Its strength is below T0 and T1, but it becomes more stable with high troop counts and titles.

##### Team 10: Caesar's Conquest Infantry (Available from Lvl 1)

![SS4 Server จีน - Era IV Preview - Land Clearing Strategy Share, Clear Land Easily with Low Losses-1756012418885.webp](/img/user/_attachments/SS4%20Server%20%E0%B8%88%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%99%20-%20Era%20IV%20Preview%20-%20Land%20Clearing%20Strategy%20Share,%20Clear%20Land%20Easily%20with%20Low%20Losses-1756012418885.webp)

| **Skill 2** | 箭雨流星 (Meteor Arrows)⁴ | 王者/整军 (Kingly Aura / Rally Troops)⁵      | 镇卫护軍 (Garrison Guard)           |

> [!NOTE] **Translation Notes:**
> ¹ [战无不克/Zhàn Wú Bù Kè] An idiom meaning "to be victorious in every battle." ² [避实击虚/Bì Shí Jī Xū] A tactical idiom meaning to evade the enemy's strengths and attack their weaknesses. ³ [绝地反击/Juédì Fǎnjī] An idiom for "counter-attacking from a hopeless or desperate situation." ⁴ [箭雨流星/Jiàn Yǔ Liúxīng] Lit. "Arrow Rain, Flowing Stars," suggesting a shower of arrows as swift and dense as a meteor shower. ⁵ [王者/Wáng Zhě] Lit. "King," likely a buff representing a king's presence. [整军/Zhěng Jūn] Lit. "To reorganize the army," likely a healing or recovery skill.

**Comment:** Formerly the strongest team before level 20. Now there are superior systems like the Dudu and Wei Qing teams. However, it is still a relatively strong team and remains viable.

> ¹ [避实击虚/Bì Shí Jī Xū] A tactical idiom meaning to evade the enemy's strengths and attack their weaknesses. ² [备武修文/Bèi Wǔ Xiū Wén] An idiom meaning to prepare military forces while also cultivating civil governance; to maintain both martial strength and internal order. ³ [勇冠三军/Yǒng Guàn Sān Jūn] An idiom describing a warrior whose bravery surpasses that of the entire army. ⁴ [重整队形/Chóngzhěng Duìxíng] Lit. "To reorganize the formation." [镇卫/Zhèn Wèi] Likely a shorthand for 镇卫护军 (Garrison Guard).

**Comment:** A very F2P-friendly team. The vanguard can be replaced with various semi-DPS heroes like Zhang Fei or Antony. In the worst case, a Spartan hero can be used. Note that the skill [Champion of the Three Armies]⁶ requires three different troop types to be active; otherwise, you'll need to bring [King's Rise]⁷ to ensure survival.

### Land Clearing Process

- **Civilization Choice:** Start with Huaxia (China) to level up quickly. Switch to Egypt after you have cleared all level 8 lands or reached the Iron Age.

- **Landing:** Immediately send out 3 armies to burn stamina. Stamina recovery will be less efficient later, as Huaxia (China) has a 200 stamina cap.

- **Gacha/Drawing Cards:** First, draw your main heroes and use them to clear land and consume stamina. Only begin mass-drawing cards after your teams have used up a significant amount of stamina to avoid waste.

- **Dismantling for Skill EXP:** If you have the means, use Gold to dismantle stored 3-4 star cards for a large amount of skill experience, which will make land clearing much smoother. If not, dismantle 4-star cards or use Silver coins.

- **Prestige Shop (Must Buys):**
    - **Skill EXP:** For land clearing.
    - **Resource Packs:** Resources are everything.
    - **Envoys:** The importance of trade envoys in the early game is self-evident.
    - **Administrative Points:** For Garrison Farming⁸, no explanation needed.
    - **Militia:** Most people will fail a few times during land clearing. More troops mean more room for error.
    - **Emergency Mobilization Order:** Same as Militia.
    - **Great Person Points:** Depending on your needs.

#### Detailed Early Game Start-up Flow (For Top Players: Open Level 5 Land at 0 Stamina)

1. **Civilization Choice:** Recommended to start with Huaxia (China) for the massive experience bonus. Switch to Egypt in the Iron Age or when stamina is depleted.

2. **Clearing Land:** You can utilize the stamina swap mechanic to use 1-2 teams to clear land indefinitely with low losses, quickly taking all level 7 and 8 lands. If you have Wei Qing, use him on rotation.
    
    - **Plan 1:** Wei Qing + Qin Shi Huang + Pericles. The strongest land clearing team for all stages. Use it if you have the heroes and skills.
    
    - **Plan 2:** The Dudu team is also a strong team throughout all stages. Unlike the Peach Garden team which requires level 20, this team can be used for land clearing before level 20.
    
    - **Plan 3:** Use Alexander, Caesar, and Zhang Fei before level 20, then switch to the Peach Garden team after level 20.

3. **Early Game Tips:** You can reset titles to add duplicates to your heroes, then promote them again at level 40. Remember to complete quests quickly and push through the civilization chapters!

4. **Barbarian Camp Mechanic:** Barbarian camps heal every 7 minutes and cost no stamina. During the novice period, hero serious injury time is 2 minutes. You can attack a maximum of 4 times. Defeating them gives a fixed amount of experience. If a hero is seriously injured, wait for them to recover before having the team receive the experience together.

| **High-Power Player Version** <br> _(Applicable to players with a full hero collection)_ | 1. The primary recommended team is **Wei/Qin/Pe**, as other teams have higher battle losses. The Dudu and Alexander teams are also good alternatives before level 20. After level 20, if you don't have Wei Qing, you can choose from the T1 teams.<br><br>2. Continuously attack Barbarian Camps directly. Keep hitting Level 2, 3, 4, and 5 camps. Do not waste stamina on other land tiles. This is because you always get full experience from camps. If your heroes are seriously injured, just wait for the recovery timer to finish and attack again immediately. By using the Huaxia civilization, you can reach level 11 just from this.<br><br>3. Look for easier level 5 lands. However, high-power teams can generally clear any level 5 land with ease. Prioritize attacking defender teams categorized as "Survival" type. Once you start, continue to clear level 5 lands.<br><br>4. At this stage, a Wei Qing or Dudu team with high/max duplicates can attack level 6 Barbarian Camps at **level 16**. An Alexander team can do so at **level 18**. If your heroes have no duplicates, wait 1-2 more levels: Alexander at level 19, Wei Qing/Dudu at levels 17-18.<br><br>5. After clearing a level 6 Barbarian Camp, level 6 land tiles will become available. You should be around levels 17-18, so you can clear them without needing to be level 20. **Wei Qing and Dudu teams** can attack level 6 land directly; choose the easiest "Survival" type defenders. For an Alexander team, if it doesn't have high duplicates, wait until level 20. With high duplicates, you can attack at **levels 18-19**, although this team is a bit weaker than the first two.<br><br>6. When you reach level 20, if you plan to switch teams, do it now and equip all their skills. Note the differences here: A **high-duplicate Wei Qing team at levels 20-22 can clear easy level 7 land!** In contrast, the **Peach Garden, Dudu, and Columbus teams need to be around levels 25-26** for stable clearing!!<br><br>7. After clearing level 7 land, begin farming experience stably until you reach levels 30-31. All T0-T1 teams can then attempt to clear easy level 8 land.<br><br>8. Swap your main team with level 1 heroes (set up the team you intend to use, swapping them with your 2nd or 3rd teams that need leveling) and repeat the process. Note that this guide has so far assumed no use of Special Training EXP. You can use Special Training EXP to instantly get heroes to level 20 for the fastest power-leveling. In that case, you don't need to use stamina from early events, which also speeds up leveling. If you use Special Training EXP, you can attack level 3 land at level 1, and after clearing level 4 land, you will reach level 10 and can begin clearing level 5 land. |
**Requirements:**

1. Skill experience must be as high as possible; skills need to be high level.
2. Teams should have high duplicates if possible, and use the recommended T0 and T1 teams.
3. Note that some teams are only usable after level 20.

**Other Notes:**

1. The difficulty of Ruins is about 2 levels higher than land of the same level. You can attempt a Ruin once you can reliably clear land of the same level without relying on luck.
2. The impact of hero duplicates is less significant for clearing level 4-6 lands, but it becomes much more important for level 7-8 lands. As long as you are using one of the specified teams, you should have no problem transitioning smoothly to level 7 land.

| **Pure F2P Version** | 1. Right at the start, directly attack level 2 Barbarian Camps (as they don't cost stamina).<br><br>2. Continuously attack Barbarian Camps, hitting levels 2, 3, and 4. You will reach level 9 after you are done.<br><br>3. If you fail to defeat a level 5 Barbarian Camp after trying the maximum number of times (4 attempts), then go clear a level 4 land tile to reach level 10 first, and then try the camp again. If you succeed in defeating the camp, you will reach level 11.<br><br>4. After defeating a level 5 Barbarian Camp, you will be level 11-12. Select an easy level 5 land tile to clear first.<br><br>5. Once you've cleared your first one, you can stably farm level 5 lands, so continue doing so. At around level 19, attack a level 6 Barbarian Camp to get the last bit of experience needed to hit level 20. At level 20, equip all skills on your heroes and begin clearing level 6 land.<br><br>6. Continuously farm level 6 land until you are level 28 or higher. You can then attempt a first clear on a particularly easy level 7 land. **However, the recommended path for F2P players is to progress quests to Chapter 9 and use the Special Training EXP reward to jump directly to level 30.** At level 30 with 12,000 troops, you can basically clear any level 7 land. Use stamina gained from events to continuously and stably clear level 7 lands.<br><br>7. There's no need to rush clearing level 8 land. If your team is on the weaker side, wait until you are **level 35 or have 15,000 troops** and have unlocked the Royal Academy. For now, focus on ensuring you can stably clear level 7 land.<br><br>8. Swap your main team with level 1 heroes (set up the team you intend to use, swapping them with your 2nd or 3rd teams that need leveling) and repeat the process. Note that the steps above assumed no use of Special Training EXP. **You can use it to instantly boost heroes to level 10 or even 20 for the fastest power-leveling.** |





**F2P Land Clearing Situation:**

1. Skill levels are relatively low, typically around levels 7-8.
2. Teams have no duplicates and are not T0 or T1, possibly even worse than T2 teams.

**Other Notes:** The difficulty of Ruins is about 2 levels higher than land of the same level. You can attempt them once you can clear land reliably.

### Land Difficulty and Recommended Troop Strength

This table shows the minimum troop strength required with maxed-out skill levels. If you want to play it safe, wait 1-2 more hero levels before attempting. Be sure to pick easy-to-defeat armies, such as those with low damage output (e.g., teams with multiple healing skills are recommended first targets). Do not blindly push for the absolute minimum. As long as you can use multiple teams to clear land, filling up your territory is fast and easy. The easiest land defenders are survival-type teams. Remember, you can check the team's tendency to see its type if you don't know how to differentiate them. The general difficulty is: **Damage > Control > Survival**. Survival-type teams are the weakest.

### Summary of Techniques

**Edict Purchase and Use**

- Purchase all daily edicts. Focus Garrison Farming on Iron and Stone to level up buildings. The return on Garrison Farming Tech Points is low; as long as you have enough food, don't use it on tech.

**Aqueduct Planning**

- Land must be developed, improved, and conquered around your main and sub-cities to receive a 20% resource production bonus.

**Technology Progression**

- Upgrade the Royal Academy until you can stably clear level 8 land. Save the rest of your resources for technology buildings. Max out the Monument as soon as possible, and build multiple Libraries. Clear as many level 7+ Ruins as you can.

**Land Conquest**

- You don't need to fight for high-level land. Focus on low-loss battles + aqueduct planning to reduce resource consumption and develop faster.

- Make good use of the free skill and troop swaps during the land clearing period. Use multiple teams to clear land, utilizing all your stamina to conquer more territory.

**Resource Production Allocation**

- In the early game, keep food production as low as possible, prioritizing high Iron and Stone production. Maintain just enough food for troop recruitment and land conquest.

- An Iron-to-Stone ratio of 1:1.5 is ideal (e.g., 50k Iron, 75k-80k Stone). Any shortfall can be covered by Garrison Farming.

**Team Configuration**

- During the early land clearing period, skills can be swapped for free, and dismissing troops returns 100% of the reserve forces. Once Team 1's stamina is depleted, immediately swap to Team 2 (with free troop and skill changes).

- Use this feature to maximize the use of the cards in your inventory. Level multiple teams and use the extra stamina to quickly conquer land.

- After the land clearing phase, these extra teams can be converted into siege teams (higher level means higher demolition value) or serve as follow-up pathing and clean-up support teams.

- The optimal 5-team setup for your main city is: 3 main combat teams and 2 siege teams (siege engines and flying units). Early on, this will be 1 main team and 2 siege teams (one of which can be converted to siege engines).

~~**Stamina Swap Trick in Practice**~~ 
~~What's the trick to using Wei Qing or your strongest team continuously? Find a level 1 hero to swap with, because hero swaps also swap their current stamina. This allows you to use your single strongest team to power-level all your other teams. After the swap, Wei Qing will have full stamina and can repeat the land clearing process. Furthermore, since you can use special training EXP to shorten the phase of clearing level 5 and 6 lands, this method can result in your main team leveling even faster than a single-team approach.~~

### Early Game Garrison Farming Development Planning

This is the most crucial technique for hyper-accelerated development, potentially giving you 20-30% more resources than others! Look for land plots like the one in the image below.

![SS4 Server จีน - Era IV Preview - Land Clearing Strategy Share, Clear Land Easily with Low Losses-1756016032860.webp](/img/user/_attachments/SS4%20Server%20%E0%B8%88%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%99%20-%20Era%20IV%20Preview%20-%20Land%20Clearing%20Strategy%20Share,%20Clear%20Land%20Easily%20with%20Low%20Losses-1756016032860.webp)

After developing them, they will become adjacent developed plots, perfect for concentrated Garrison Farming (preferably near a main city aqueduct for future bonuses).

![SS4 Server จีน - Era IV Preview - Land Clearing Strategy Share, Clear Land Easily with Low Losses-1756016041443.webp](/img/user/_attachments/SS4%20Server%20%E0%B8%88%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%99%20-%20Era%20IV%20Preview%20-%20Land%20Clearing%20Strategy%20Share,%20Clear%20Land%20Easily%20with%20Low%20Losses-1756016041443.webp)

The most important mechanic is that when the central point of Garrison Farming is adjacent to other resources, it provides an additional **+15%** yield based on the adjacent plot's level. This means if a plot is adjacent to 5-6 plots of the same level, you will gain a **90% bonus** to Garrison Farming resources. While Garrison Farming for tech points early on is a tempo loss, it is _not_ a loss if you do it on adjacent tech plots. Refer to the image below for a clear comparison.

_Garrison Farming a single level 8 Iron plot only yields 70k resources._

_Garrison Farming the same level 8 Iron plot, but with 6 adjacent resource plots, yields much more._

### Version Summary

- **Land Clearing Teams:** A hundred flowers bloom. Strong land clearing teams from previous eras are still powerful, especially Wei Qing. The newly added Zhou Yu and Columbus are also very strong.

- **Land Defender Lineups:** Defender compositions before level 8 land have not changed much; the difficulty and tempo are the same. Level 9 land has many new lineups, and level 10 land will also be slightly more difficult than before.

- **Other Techniques:** Existing tricks and techniques have not changed and are still applicable.
