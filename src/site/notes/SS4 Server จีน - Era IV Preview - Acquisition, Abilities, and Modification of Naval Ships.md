Source: World Qiyuan Mobile Game

Date: November 15, 2024, 23:10

Pioneers will experience the fun of naval warfare gameplay in Era IV. So, what naval ships are there? How are they operated and used? Today, we bring you a detailed introduction to naval combat units to help you familiarize yourselves with the naval combat environment.

### Basic Explanation

I. Basic Introduction

A ship is a type of overall unit selection for a land-based army when it enters a sea region. The attributes and combat rules for Pioneers engaging in naval combat are mostly the same as on land.

Additionally, ships must be unlocked before they can be used. Each ship has a usage limit of 2 times.

### Ship Acquisition

Pioneers can build a **Shipyard to gain the ability to use** **and** **modify** **ships**. By unlocking the corresponding era's ships through Era Technology, they provide ship choices for converting land-based armies into naval units.

#### I. Unlocking Ships

	Unlock the [Shipyard] construction function through technology. Once unlocked, the [Shipyard] can be built in the main city and all sub-cities and can be upgraded to the maximum level.

	The main city and sub-cities will have a new city building, the [Shipyard]. After constructing any [Shipyard], the [Land Unit to Naval Unit Conversion] function can be used in buildings such as [Docks, Port Cities, and certain Passes] to convert land units into naval units.

#### II. Using Ships

At a departure point such as a Dock, after selecting a ship type for an army, it is considered that the army has used that type of ship once. The usage limit for each ship type is 2 times. It cannot be used after exceeding this limit.

#### III. Ship Classification

Ships are classified according to their main role and tendency into DPS Ships, Survival Ships, and Control Ships. Similar to the original army tendencies, they will provide corresponding types of inherent and modifiable abilities, and possess strategic functions such as Bombardment, Anti-Air, and Fast.

![SS4 Server ‡∏à‡∏µ‡∏ô - Era IV Preview - Acquisition, Abilities, and Modification of Naval Ships-1755966722352.webp](/img/user/_attachments/SS4%20Server%20%E0%B8%88%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%99%20-%20Era%20IV%20Preview%20-%20Acquisition,%20Abilities,%20and%20Modification%20of%20Naval%20Ships-1755966722352.webp)

Based on the effects provided by their Inherent and Modifiable Abilities, ships form different combat tendencies and functional types. These include:
##### Combat Tendency
- **‚öîÔ∏è DPS Tendency Ships:** Possess more effects that increase damage and activation rates.
- **üõ°Ô∏è Survival Tendency Ships:** Possess more effects that increase healing, damage reduction, and evasion.
- **‚óé Control Tendency Ships:** Possess more effects that increase control abilities and provide buffs after applying control effects.
##### Functional Type
- **üí• Bombardment Type Ships:** Possess a bombardment ability. When deployed, they can deal damage to distant targets.
- **üéØ Anti-Air Type Ships:** Possess an anti-air ability. When deployed, they can automatically attack flying units that enter their anti-air range.
- **‚è© Fast Type Ships:** Possess higher movement speed.

Below are the ship types corresponding to different eras and their ability characteristics:

Translator's Note: The original article likely contains a list or image here detailing the specific ship types per era, which was not included in the provided text.

#### IV. Ship Modification

1. How to Modify:
    
	A new currency resource - **Modification Blueprints** - has been added. Pioneers can consume Modification Blueprints to perform ship modifications on each unlocked ship to improve its attributes or acquire new abilities.
    
    **Modification Blueprints** can be obtained through the following ways:
    
    - Obtain a certain number of Modification Blueprints by upgrading the Shipyard.
    - After the corresponding progression is completed, all Pioneers will receive a certain number of Modification Blueprints.
    
2. Modification Reset:
    
	The modifications for each ship can also be reset by consuming a certain amount of Gold. This resets the current ship's modified attributes and abilities and fully refunds the consumed Modification Blueprints (there is no cooldown for resetting).
    
3. Modification Precautions:
    
	When a ship is undergoing modification, it cannot be at sea. It must be docked at a building like a dock or port, be unused, or be on land.
    

#### V. Inherent and Modifiable Abilities of Ships
