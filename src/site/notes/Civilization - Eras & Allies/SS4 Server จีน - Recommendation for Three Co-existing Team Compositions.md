**Team Composition Logic**

The idea behind this team is relatively simple. It utilizes Tomyris equipped with Sword of Protection for immunity to control effects, allowing her to reliably provide buffs to Columbus.

After Columbus stacks his buffs, combined with Qin Shi Huang's _Decisive Flood from a Thousand Fathoms_ [决水千仞] and _Movement in the Nine Heavens_ [动于九天], he can consistently deal high amounts of damage. At the same time, Qin Shi Huang provides control to reduce battle losses in the first three rounds. Typically, this team can eliminate most opponents in 2-3 rounds, making it very powerful.

This team does not have a very high requirement for hero "redness" [红度, likely referring to hero rarity or number of duplicates], so it is accessible for free-to-play players. High-spending players can opt for Isabella I, who provides a more stable and larger damage bonus for Columbus (equipped with Coronation + Sword of Protection).

**Stat Allocation and Troop Details**

Qin Shi Huang and Tomyris need to allocate some points into Agility to gain speed priority, ensuring they act first. It is especially important for Tomyris to act first to apply damage increase and reduction buffs to Columbus.

For troops, Tomyris must use a combo-based intelligence-damage troop type. The other two heroes can use their recommended troop types.

**Counters and Weaknesses**

This team is a strong counter to the various tanky teams currently in the meta, including the Zhou Yu system and counter-attack systems (though success against the latter may depend on redness). Against other teams, it can often achieve a 50/50 win rate. It has no particularly obvious "natural enemy," but it can sometimes be out-bursted by other, faster burst-damage teams.

**Naval Battle Configuration**

Focus on stacking Columbus's damage amplification multiplier.

---

**Team Composition Logic**

Zhou Yu (=> Jang Bogo)'s stable opening damage, combined with Zhuge Liang's Intelligence reduction, results in very considerable damage when stacked up to rounds 4-5. At the same time, Zhou Yu carries Yang Flame [阳焰] + Divine Strategy and Wondrous Tactics [神机妙算] to increase his damage.

Zhuge Liang, paired with Lu Su (=> Magellan) + _Delaying Tactics_ [迁延战术] + _Military Reorganization_ [整军经武], provides very strong damage reduction and control, allowing the team to stall until Zhou Yu's damage peaks. This is another team that is viable for free-to-play players, though it is naturally stronger with high redness.

**Stat Allocation and Troop Details**

Allocate all stat points into Intelligence. For troops, Zhuge Liang and Lu Su can use intelligence-support troop types, while Zhou Yu should use an intelligence-damage troop type.

**Counters and Weaknesses**

This team counters counter-attack teams and has a significant advantage against some other tanky teams. In a mirror match against a pure "Dudu" [都督, Governor-General, a common nickname for teams with Zhou Yu, Lu Su, and Lu Meng/Lu Xun] team, it also holds a large advantage.

It also has the potential to trade kills against some Qin Shi Huang/Cao Cao physical damage teams or Qin Shi Huang fast-attack teams, often being able to stall until round 3-4 to defeat the opponent. It is extremely weak against the _Unstoppable_ [锐不可当] Joan of Arc system, especially lineups featuring Guan Yu and Huo Qubing.

**Team Composition Logic**

When Lu Xun is paired with Christina + Unstoppable [锐不可当], his skill activation rate can be increased to over 80%. When further combined with Joan of Arc, the activation rate approaches 100%.

In round one, he activates _Resourceful and Strange_ [智略多奇], and in round two, he triggers a massive damage explosion in conjunction with _Orthodoxy and Unorthodoxy Interacting_ [奇正相生].

Simultaneously, Joan of Arc + Christina + _A Hundred Refinements_ [百炼千锤] provide a massive damage increase, while _Unstoppable_ [锐不可当] + _A Hundred Refinements_ [百炼千锤] offer powerful control immunity. This lineup is effective at both low and high redness.

**Stat Allocation and Troop Details**

For stat points, Lu Xun can add some Agility to gain speed priority. For troops, the recommended types can be used.

**Counters and Weaknesses**

This team counters tanky teams in every sense of the word and has an advantage against most of them, especially counter-attack teams. It is slightly countered by "Dudu" teams.

It is relatively weak against Qin Shi Huang/Cao Cao physical damage teams, traditional Cao Cao physical damage teams, and Columbus burst teams. When facing other active-skill-based teams like those with Guan Yu or Huo Qubing, the outcome depends on the performance of both sides.

**Team Composition Logic**

Compared to the previous lineup with Tomyris, this version uses Isabella I. The advantage of Isabella I is that she stacks the effects of Columbus's skills faster, resulting in higher output and stronger front-line killing potential.

After Columbus stacks his buffs, combined with the dual enhancement from Qin Shi Huang, he can consistently deal high damage. Qin Shi Huang also provides control to reduce losses in the first three rounds.

This team has stronger killing power against tanky teams because the damage output of Columbus + Isabella I is higher and can be directed to instantly kill a single target.

Compared to the Tomyris version, this team has a higher ceiling but also has a certain requirement for redness.

**Stat Allocation and Troop Details**

This team does not need to prioritize Agility; simply focus on speed and deliver heavy blows to tanky teams. For troops, Isabella I must use a combo-based intelligence-damage troop type. The other two can use their recommended troop types.

**Counters and Weaknesses**

This team is a strong counter to the various tanky teams currently in the meta, including the Zhou Yu system and counter-attack systems (though success against the latter may depend on redness). Against other teams, it can often achieve a 50/50 win rate. It has no particularly obvious "natural enemy," but it can sometimes lose to other, faster burst-damage teams.

**Naval Battle Configuration**

Focus on stacking Columbus's damage amplification multiplier.

**Team Composition Logic**

Huo Qubing deals damage using Storm Arrow [风暴之箭] + Invincible in Battle [战无不克]. Joan of Arc + Emperor Wu of Han form a dual damage amplification setup to maximize Huo Qubing's output.

Here, _Courage of a Common Man_ [匹夫奋勇] and _Unstoppable_ [锐不可当] further increase Huo Qubing's damage and control immunity, while _Set Things Right_ [扶正] is used for its pre-emptive dispel to ensure skills are cast successfully. _Total Blockade_ [全境封锁] provides an advantage in battles against other active-skill-based teams.

This is a team with a very high ceiling and incredible damage potential, but it requires redness to support the damage amplification and speed to act first.

**Stat Allocation and Troop Details**

Huo Qubing needs to invest in Agility for a pre-emptive burst. Joan of Arc should also add Agility (and must be faster than Huo Qubing to dispel first). Other stats can follow the recommended allocation. For troops, the recommended types can be used.

**Counters and Weaknesses**

It is a hard counter to all kinds of slow, tanky teams, including the enhanced Caesar. It can trade kills with some fast-attack teams by bursting them down first. It is relatively weak against Qin Shi Huang/Cao Cao physical damage teams and traditional Cao Cao physical damage teams.

**Team Composition Logic**

Zhou Yu's stable opening damage, combined with Zhuge Liang's Intelligence reduction, results in very considerable damage when stacked up to rounds 4-5. Zhou Yu also carries Yang Flame [阳焰] + Divine Strategy and Wondrous Tactics [神机妙算] to increase his damage.

Zhuge Liang and Zhang Fei form a combination with _Auspicious General's Heavenly Might_ [诞将天威] + _Attack Where They Are Weak_ [避实击虚] + _Military Reorganization_ [整军经武]. Zhang Fei carries _Guard the Army_ [护卫镇军] and _Last Stand Counterattack_ [绝地反击] to withstand the damage from enemy physical damage teams.

This is a team accessible to free-to-play players, though it is naturally stronger with high redness.

**Stat Allocation and Troop Details**

Follow the recommended stat allocations. For troops, use the recommended types, with Zhou Yu selecting an intelligence-damage troop.

**Counters and Weaknesses**

It counters counter-attack teams and some active-skill-based tanky teams, but it struggles slightly in mirror matches against pure "Dudu" teams or the Zhuge Liang/Lu Su/Zhou Yu variant.

Against Qin Shi Huang physical damage teams, it has the ability to trade kills, provided Zhang Fei can withstand the damage. It is prone to losing against physical damage teams with high stats and against Columbus teams. It is extremely weak against the _Unstoppable_ [锐不可当] Joan of Arc system, especially lineups featuring Guan Yu + Huo Qubing.
