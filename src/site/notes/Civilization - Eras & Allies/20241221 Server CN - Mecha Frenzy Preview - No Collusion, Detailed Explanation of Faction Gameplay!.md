## 【Era Settlement】
At the same time, Pioneers no longer have to worry about a situation where, due to a low alliance evaluation, their significant personal contributions go unrewarded! In terms of settlement, the new Era has also undergone major adjustments! In addition to the faction settlement, a personal settlement and rewards have been added. As long as you contribute, you will definitely be rewarded.

### Personal Settlement:
Pioneers within a faction gain Era Points through various active behaviors. A ranking is conducted within the faction based on these points, and corresponding rewards are given at the time of Era settlement. A maximum of 1500 **Gold Coins** [Simplified: 金币 / Traditional: 金幣], 25 **Great Person Points** [Simplified: 伟人点数 / Traditional: 偉人點數], and 2000 **Age Points** [Simplified: 时代点数 / Traditional: 時代點數] can be obtained.

### Faction Settlement:
(1) Alliances under a faction will acquire occupation points for capturing different cities. Factions will be ranked based on these occupation points. Pioneers in the faction will receive evaluations and rewards based on the faction's rank.
(2) In the faction, the leader and officials of the nation-founding alliance will receive additional rewards.
