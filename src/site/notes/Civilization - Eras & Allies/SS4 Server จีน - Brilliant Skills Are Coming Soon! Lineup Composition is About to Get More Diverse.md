### Brilliant Skills

![SS4 Server จีน - Brilliant Skills Are Coming Soon! Lineup Composition is About to Get More Diverse-1756128656493.webp](/img/user/_attachments/SS4%20Server%20%E0%B8%88%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%99%20-%20Brilliant%20Skills%20Are%20Coming%20Soon!%20Lineup%20Composition%20is%20About%20to%20Get%20More%20Diverse-1756128656493.webp)
#### 1. Unstoppable (锐不可当)
- **Type:** Opening
- **Range:** 3
- **Chance:** 100%
- **Skill Effect:** For the first 3 rounds of battle, 2 allied heroes gain immunity to Silence, and their Active Skill activation chance is increased by (Opening) 5%. During this period, the target heroes are in a Disarmed state. [This is a self-inflicted status, cannot be dispelled, and is not affected by Super Armor or any other immunity effects].
- **Heroes Required for Exchange:** Joan of Arc, William Wallace, Charlemagne
- **Tier:** T0
- **Review:** This is a god-tier support skill for Active Skill-based archetypes, suitable for various active-damage heroes, especially those with ultra-high burst like Guan Yu and Huo Qubing. The only potential issue is that the buff might not land on the core hero. This skill also serves as a major counter to counter-attack teams.

#### 2. Deep Hypnosis (深度催眠)
- **Type:** Active
- **Range:** 4
- **Chance:** 20%
- **Skill Effect:** After a 1-round preparation, inflict Silence on 2 random enemy heroes for 1 round. In the following round, they will also be inflicted with Exhaustion. (Activation chance 20%).
- **Heroes Required for Exchange:** Han Xin, Consort Yu, Meng Tian
- **Tier:** T1
- **Review:** An active control skill suitable for slow-speed teams. Its strength is comparable to skills like _Heart Breaker_ and _Demoralize_. It is a viable option for slow, tanky teams and also has a restraining effect on counter-attack archetypes.

#### 3. Demoralizing Words (诛心之论)
- **Type:** Active
- **Range:** 5
- **Chance:** 40%
- **Skill Effect:** Deals Physical Damage 1 time to 2 enemy heroes (Damage Rate 40%) and increases the Physical Damage they receive by (In-battle) 7.5% (affected by the Attack attribute) for 2 rounds. Then, deals Physical Damage 1 time to 2 enemy heroes (Damage Rate 40%) and significantly reduces the next single instance of damage they deal. Each damage target is determined independently.
- **Heroes Required for Exchange:** Guan Yu, Alexander, Pericles
- **Tier:** T1
- **Review:** A powerful physical-type Active Skill. It is a good fit for Guan Yu and also suitable for some tank teams that attack frequently, such as one led by Pericles.

#### 4. Elite Troops & Great Generals (兵精将广)
- **Type:** Opening
- **Range:** 3
- **Chance:** 100%
- **Skill Effect:** When your 3 allied heroes are all of different troop types, the Commander's Normal Attack range +1; the damage received by the Center hero is reduced by (Opening) 10%; for the first 3 rounds of battle, the Vanguard hero protects all allies.
- **Heroes Required for Exchange:** Tomyris, Queen Dido, King David
- **Tier:** T2
- **Review:** This is the Pursuit version of _Champion of the Three Armies_ [An existing skill]. However, there are not many heroes in the Commander position who need increased Normal Attack range. Furthermore, Pursuit teams that also require three different troop types are even rarer. It is presumed this skill is designed to synergize with new heroes and archetypes in the Fourth Era.

#### 5. Swift Cavalry General (骠骑飞将)
- **Type:** Opening
- **Range:** 3
- **Chance:** 100%
- **Skill Effect:** Increases the damage dealt by allied cavalry heroes' Active Skills by (Opening) 7.5% (affected by the Agility attribute).
- **Heroes Required for Exchange:** El Cid, Duke of Wellington, Oda Nobunaga
- **Tier:** T1
- **Review:** A support skill for cavalry-based Active Skill generals. It is well-suited for heroes who need a damage boost, such as William Wallace, El Cid, and Huo Qubing. Its actual strength will require testing in battle, but the numbers look promising.

#### 6. Battlefield Whirlwind (战场旋风)
- **Type:** Opening
- **Range:** 3
- **Chance:** 100%
- **Skill Effect:** Increases the damage dealt by allied melee heroes' Normal Attacks by 25% and adds a splash effect. When dealing a Normal Attack, it also deals 25% of the original damage to 1 unit adjacent to the target.
- **Heroes Required for Exchange:** Spartacus, Harald, Xu Chu
- **Tier:** T2
- **Review:** A skill for melee-based, Normal Attack-focused heroes. The numbers are good, but the current problem is the lack of strong melee Normal Attack DPS heroes. It is presumed this is intended to be paired with new heroes and archetypes in the Fourth Era.

#### 7. Composure in Crisis (处变不惊)
- **Type:** Active
- **Range:** 3
- **Chance:** 40%
- **Skill Effect:** Reduces damage received by all allies by (In-battle) 10% (affected by the Intellect attribute) and increases damage dealt by (In-battle) 7.5% (affected by the Intellect attribute).
- **Heroes Required for Exchange:** Han Xin, Gilgamesh, Sun Tzu
- **Tier:** T1
- **Review:** A damage reduction and amplification skill for slow-paced archetypes. It fits well with Caesar-led tank teams, counter-attack tank teams, and various other mid-to-slow speed compositions, effectively boosting both survivability and damage output.

#### 8. Maximum Power (最大功率)
- **Type:** Active
- **Range:** 4
- **Chance:** 40%
- **Skill Effect:** Increases own Attack attribute by 15 (affected by the Intellect attribute) and gains the following effect: When receiving Physical Damage, deal Intellect Damage 1 time to the damage source (Damage Rate 75%, affected by Intellect attribute). When receiving Intellect Damage, deal Physical Damage 1 time to the damage source (Damage Rate 100%). This effect can trigger up to 4 times and lasts for 2 rounds.
- **Heroes Required for Exchange:** Cleopatra, Richard I, Guan Yu
- **Tier:** T1
- **Review:** This skill is well-suited for current counter-attack archetypes. It is powerful on both Cleopatra and Sun Tzu. Pairing it with a counter-attack team that includes Pericles will further enhance the team's strength.

Once a skill has been exchanged, the Hero Cards used cannot be returned. We advise Pioneers to exchange for skills based on their own needs to avoid any unnecessary losses.

### Meta Impact

Currently, the overall meta consists of the following team archetypes:

1. **Opening Control + Burst Teams:** For example, the Bai Qi and Qin Shi Huang system.
2. **Pursuit Burst Teams:** The Saladin system, or Pursuit combined with Qin Shi Huang and Cao Cao.
3. **Slow-Speed Tank Teams:** Represented by the Caesar system and counter-attack tank teams. These can be full Passive/Opening counter teams or slow Active Skill tank teams with Caesar.
4. **Mid-Speed Active Skill Teams:** The Joan of Arc system paired with active burst heroes like Guan Yu, Huo Qubing, or William Wallace.

In the Third Era meta, Active Skill systems were relatively weaker, while counter-attack teams within the slow-tank category were dominant. In some cases, counter-attack teams could even win against Active Skill teams despite the typical counter-matchup. Pursuit burst and Opening burst teams were very strong and popular.

The introduction of Brilliant Skills will significantly improve various non-counter, mid-to-slow speed Active Skill teams, as most of these new skills are designed to be used with Active Skills.

Furthermore, the core skill **Unstoppable (锐不可当)** will greatly enhance the ability to counter counter-attack teams (with its activation chance increase + self-disarm + silence immunity). It can be said that in the Fourth Era, the usage rate and strength of various mid-to-slow speed Active Skill teams are expected to rise significantly.

### Skill & Team Compositions

#### 1. Recommended Team for Unstoppable (锐不可当)

![SS4 Server จีน - Brilliant Skills Are Coming Soon! Lineup Composition is About to Get More Diverse-1755964845690.webp](/img/user/_attachments/SS4%20Server%20%E0%B8%88%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%99%20-%20Brilliant%20Skills%20Are%20Coming%20Soon!%20Lineup%20Composition%20is%20About%20to%20Get%20More%20Diverse-1755964845690.webp)

**Team Composition: Victory at Mount Langjuxu** Translator's Note: "封狼居胥" (Fēng Láng Jū Xū) is a historical allusion to the famous victory of General Huo Qubing, where he performed a ritual sacrifice at Mount Langjuxu to declare his triumph.

|                      | **Huo Qubing**     | **Joan of Arc**   | **Emperor Wu of Han** |
| -------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| **Hero Name**        | Huo Qubing         | Joan of Arc       | Emperor Wu of Han     |
| **Skill 1**          | Arrow of the Storm | Total Blockade    | Overwhelming Flood    |
| **Skill 2**          | Invincible         | ==Unstoppable==   | Heavenly Maneuver     |
| **Recommended Role** | Physical DPS       | Intellect Support | Intellect Support     |
| **Position**         | Commander          | Center            | Vanguard              |

**Explanation:** This is an extreme burst team composition for Huo Qubing. It is highly effective against counter-attack teams and various tank teams. Against other team types, its success depends on its burst speed; if fast enough, it has a chance to one-shot the opponent.

#### 2. Recommended Team for Deep Hypnosis (深度催眠)

![SS4 Server จีน - Brilliant Skills Are Coming Soon! Lineup Composition is About to Get More Diverse-1755965046961.webp](/img/user/_attachments/SS4%20Server%20%E0%B8%88%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%99%20-%20Brilliant%20Skills%20Are%20Coming%20Soon!%20Lineup%20Composition%20is%20About%20to%20Get%20More%20Diverse-1755965046961.webp)

**Team Composition: Three Visits to Rome** Translator's Note: The title "三顾罗马" (Sān Gù Luómǎ) is a pun on the famous Chinese historical event "三顾茅庐" (Sān Gù Máolú), "Three visits to the thatched cottage," where the warlord Liu Bei recruited the strategist Zhuge Liang. Here, "茅庐" (thatched cottage) is replaced with "罗马" (Rome), referencing the mix of Chinese and Roman heroes in this lineup.

|                      | **Zhuge Liang**      | **Caesar**         | **Zhang Fei**            |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------ |
| **Hero Name**        | Zhuge Liang          | Caesar             | Zhang Fei                |
| **Skill 1**          | Solar Flame          | Exploit Weakness   | ==Deep Hypnosis==        |
| **Skill 2**          | Interplay of Tactics | Army Consolidation | Desperate Counter-attack |
| **Recommended Role** | Intellect DPS        | Intellect Support  | Defensive                |
| **Position**         | Commander            | Center             | Vanguard                 |

**Explanation:** _Deep Hypnosis_ is a viable alternative to skills like _Demoralize_ and _Heart Breaker_. It maintains strong suppressive effects against counter-attack teams.

#### 3. Recommended Team for Demoralizing Words (诛心之论)

![SS4 Server จีน - Brilliant Skills Are Coming Soon! Lineup Composition is About to Get More Diverse-1755965164057.webp](/img/user/_attachments/SS4%20Server%20%E0%B8%88%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%99%20-%20Brilliant%20Skills%20Are%20Coming%20Soon!%20Lineup%20Composition%20is%20About%20to%20Get%20More%20Diverse-1755965164057.webp)

**Team Composition: Pericles-Cleo-Antony Counter** Translator's Note: The Chinese title "伯克马反击" (Bó Kè Mǎ Fǎnjī) is an abbreviation formed from the first characters of the heroes' names: **Bó**-lǐkèlì (Pericles), **Kè**-lǐ'ōu pèi tè lā (Cleopatra), and **Mǎ**-kè Āndōngní (Mark Antony).

|                      | **Pericles**           | **Cleopatra**      | **Mark Antony**          |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------ |
| **Hero Name**        | Pericles               | Cleopatra          | Mark Antony              |
| **Skill 1**          | Parting Shot           | Delaying Tactics   | Garrison Guard           |
| **Skill 2**          | ==Demoralizing Words== | Army Consolidation | Desperate Counter-attack |
| **Recommended Role** | Physical Active DPS    | Intellect Support  | Defensive                |
| **Position**         | Commander              | Center             | Vanguard                 |

**Explanation:** With _Demoralizing Words_, Pericles provides good damage increase and damage reduction, and the skill can also actively trigger Pericles's passive.

#### 4. Recommended Team for Swift Cavalry General (骠骑飞将)

![SS4 Server จีน - Brilliant Skills Are Coming Soon! Lineup Composition is About to Get More Diverse-1755965265017.webp](/img/user/_attachments/SS4%20Server%20%E0%B8%88%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%99%20-%20Brilliant%20Skills%20Are%20Coming%20Soon!%20Lineup%20Composition%20is%20About%20to%20Get%20More%20Diverse-1755965265017.webp)

**Team Composition: Eternal Heroes**

|                      | **William Wallace**               | **El Cid**        | **Joan of Arc**           |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Hero Name**        | William Wallace                   | El Cid            | Joan of Arc               |
| **Skill 1**          | Double Shot                       | Total Blockade    | ==Swift Cavalry General== |
| **Skill 2**          | Coronation / Unrivaled by Myriads | ==Unstoppable==   | Parting Shot              |
| **Recommended Role** | Physical Pursuit DPS              | Intellect Support | Agility Support           |
| **Position**         | Commander                         | Center            | Vanguard                  |

**Explanation:** Stacking two damage-increasing skills with _Unstoppable_ can boost the output of Wallace and El Cid to a very respectable level. The Silence immunity allows them to start their burst immediately, and the Disarm effect effectively prevents them from taking damage from counter-attack teams.

#### 5. Recommended Team for Composure in Crisis (处变不惊)

![SS4 Server จีน - Brilliant Skills Are Coming Soon! Lineup Composition is About to Get More Diverse-1755965468426.webp](/img/user/_attachments/SS4%20Server%20%E0%B8%88%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%99%20-%20Brilliant%20Skills%20Are%20Coming%20Soon!%20Lineup%20Composition%20is%20About%20to%20Get%20More%20Diverse-1755965468426.webp)

**Team Composition: Three Visits to Rome** Translator's Note: The title "三顾罗马" (Sān Gù Luómǎ) is a pun on the famous Chinese historical event "三顾茅庐" (Sān Gù Máolú), "Three visits to the thatched cottage," where the warlord Liu Bei recruited the strategist Zhuge Liang. Here, "茅庐" (thatched cottage) is replaced with "罗马" (Rome), referencing the mix of Chinese and Roman heroes in this lineup.

|                      | **Zhuge Liang**      | **Caesar**              | **Zhang Fei**            |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Hero Name**        | Zhuge Liang          | Caesar                  | Zhang Fei                |
| **Skill 1**          | Solar Flame          | Exploit Weakness        | Garrison Guard           |
| **Skill 2**          | Interplay of Tactics | ==Composure in Crisis== | Desperate Counter-attack |
| **Recommended Role** | Intellect DPS        | Intellect Support       | Defensive                |
| **Position**         | Commander            | Center                  | Vanguard                 |

**Explanation:** _Composure in Crisis_ can enhance both the tankiness and damage output in prolonged battles. Compared to _Army Consolidation_, it performs better in tank-versus-tank matchups, especially since Zhuge Liang himself lacks a damage-increasing skill.

#### 6. Recommended Team for Maximum Power (最大功率)

![SS4 Server จีน - Brilliant Skills Are Coming Soon! Lineup Composition is About to Get More Diverse-1755965495930.webp](/img/user/_attachments/SS4%20Server%20%E0%B8%88%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%99%20-%20Brilliant%20Skills%20Are%20Coming%20Soon!%20Lineup%20Composition%20is%20About%20to%20Get%20More%20Diverse-1755965495930.webp)

**Team Composition: Two Sages of the Martial Temple** Translator's Note: "武庙" (Wǔ Miào) refers to a state-sponsored "Temple of War" in ancient China that honored exemplary military figures. "双哲" (Shuāng Zhé) means "Two Sages." The title highlights the presence of two of China's most renowned strategists, Zhuge Liang and Sun Tzu.

|                      | **Zhuge Liang**        | **Caesar**        | **Sun Tzu**              |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Hero Name**        | Zhuge Liang            | Caesar            | Sun Tzu                  |
| **Skill 1**          | Parting Shot           | Delaying Tactics  | ==Maximum Power==        |
| **Skill 2**          | ==Demoralizing Words== | Exploit Weakness  | Desperate Counter-attack |
| **Recommended Role** | Intellect DPS          | Intellect Support | Intellect Support        |
| **Position**         | Commander              | Center            | Vanguard                 |

**Explanation:** In this team, Sun Tzu will become a hybrid physical/intellect counter-attacker. Once _Maximum Power_ is stacked, his counter-attack frequency will be astonishing. Combined with Zhuge Liang's Intellect-based damage reduction and Caesar's protection, this team is very powerful.

#### 7. Recommended Team for Elite Troops and Grand Generals (兵精将广)

**Explanation:** It is speculated that this skill is designed to be paired with the new hero, Columbus. There are no suitable heroes or teams for it in the current system.

#### 8. Recommended Team for Battlefield Cyclone (战场旋风)

**Explanation:** It is speculated that this skill is designed to be paired with the new hero, Columbus. There are no suitable heroes or teams for it in the current system.
