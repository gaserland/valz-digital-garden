* Advancement II: The Intellect attribute increase from the innate skill is boosted by an additional 5%, and the innate skill's activation rate is increased by 10%.

**Overall Hero Evaluation**:
* **Mechanism Analysis**: With full titles, it's a 40% chance random control skill that also boosts the whole team's Intellect by 20%. It works well with Intellect-based damage dealers. As a cavalry unit, she can get the first move, making her a very good choice for F2P players who like to gamble on chance.
* **Synergy Analysis**: Can be paired with Intellect-based damage dealers as a control unit. Suitable for both slow-paced and mid-paced teams.
* **Dismantle Skill Analysis**: An opening-phase Exhaustion control skill. It's a pity that it only targets one unit with a 70% activation rate, making it quite luck-dependent. It can have miraculous effects when it controls the enemy's core hero.
