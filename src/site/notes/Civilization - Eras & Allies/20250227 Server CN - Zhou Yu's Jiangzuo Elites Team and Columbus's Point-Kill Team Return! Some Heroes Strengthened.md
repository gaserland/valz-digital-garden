After the return of the new Second Era card pack received an enthusiastic response from the Pioneers, the Third Era card pack has now been upgraded and is about to have its first return, still featuring cumulative draw rewards!
## Third Era Card Pack Details

The core heroes of the new Third Era card pack have been adjusted to: **Lu Xun** [Simplified: 陆逊 / Traditional: 陸遜], **Zhou Yu** [Simplified: 周瑜 / Traditional: 周瑜], **Lu Su** [Simplified: 鲁肃 / Traditional: 魯肅], **Isabella I** [Simplified: 伊莎贝拉一世 / Traditional: 伊莎貝拉一世], and **Columbus** [Simplified: 哥伦布 / Traditional: 哥倫布]. The card pack's return helps Pioneers fill the gaps in their lineups, unlock more team composition possibilities, and make tactical choices more flexible and varied!

**Zhou Yu** [Simplified: 周瑜 / Traditional: 周瑜], **Lu Xun** [Simplified: 陆逊 / Traditional: 陸遜], **Lu Su** [Simplified: 鲁肃 / Traditional: 魯肅]: Can form the "**Jiangzuo Elites**" [Simplified: 江左英才 / Traditional: 江左英才] Fate team, a powerful lineup for mid-to-slow speed, intelligence-based damage output. The innate skills of **Zhou Yu** [Simplified: 周瑜 / Traditional: 周瑜] and **Lu Xun** [Simplified: 陆逊 / Traditional: 陸遜] apply burn and other debuff effects to the enemy, allowing them to deal a large amount of damage in a single battle. Combined with **Lu Su's** [Simplified: 鲁肃 / Traditional: 魯肅] opening skill, "**Strategic Maneuvering**" [Simplified: 纵横捭阖 / Traditional: 縱橫捭闔], it can apply more negative effects to the enemy and beneficial effects to allies, making it very comprehensive.

**Columbus** [Simplified: 哥伦布 / Traditional: 哥倫布], **Isabella I** [Simplified: 伊莎贝拉一世 / Traditional: 伊莎貝拉一世]: Can form a point-kill team that focuses on bursting down enemy front-row heroes. As the damage core of the point-kill team, if **Columbus** [Simplified: 哥伦布 / Traditional: 哥倫布] is placed in the commander position and paired with the vanguard **Isabella I** [Simplified: 伊莎贝拉一世 / Traditional: 伊莎貝拉一世], he can quickly stack the damage layers of "**Headwind Navigation**" [Simplified: 逆风领航 / Traditional: 逆風領航] to the maximum. With full stacks, he can instantly kill the opponent's front row, dealing a massive 10,000+ damage in a single turn, achieving the goal of evaporating the enemy's front row, truly living up to the "point-kill" name.

At the same time, some of the aforementioned heroes have also received skill adjustments, which will take effect across all eras after the update on February 27th.
- **Lu Su** [Simplified: 鲁肃 / Traditional: 魯肅]: The chance for his innate skill to trigger its effect is increased from 40% to 45%; the trigger probability for the Tier 1 Title is increased from 5% to 15%, and the trigger probability for the Advanced Title is increased from 15% to 25%.
- **Zhou Yu** [Simplified: 周瑜 / Traditional: 周瑜]: The Intelligence damage dealt by his Tier 1 Title is increased from 10% to 16%, the advanced effect remains unchanged.
- "**Jiangzuo Elites**" [Simplified: 江左英才 / Traditional: 江左英才] Fate: Damage taken by all members is reduced from 15% to 20%.
- **Isabella I** [Simplified: 伊莎贝拉一世 / Traditional: 伊莎貝拉一世]: The chance for her Tier 1 Title's innate skill to trigger its damage again is increased from 10% to 20%, and the chance for the Advanced Title is increased from 20% to 30%.
