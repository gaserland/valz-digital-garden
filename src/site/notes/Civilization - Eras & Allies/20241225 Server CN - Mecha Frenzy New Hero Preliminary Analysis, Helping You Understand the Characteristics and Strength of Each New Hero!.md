**Innate Skill — Reign of Hongwu** [Simplified: 洪武之治 / Traditional: 洪武之治]
* **Skill Type**: Opening Skill
* **Activation Rate**: 100.0%
* **Effective Range**: 5

When our entire army attempts to activate an active skill (regardless of whether it activates successfully, excluding cases where it cannot be activated due to stun or silence), this hero has a 70% chance to deal Intellect damage once to 1 random enemy hero (Damage Rate 80% → 160%, affected by the Intellect attribute); after any allied hero's troops first fall below 70% of their initial troops, this effect triggers an additional time, and each time it successfully triggers, it also heals the allied hero with the fewest wounded troops (Recovery Rate 40% → 80%, affected by the Intellect attribute).

**Dismantle Skill: Exploit the Enemy for Resources** [Simplified: 因敌取资 / Traditional: 因敵取資] (Support)
* **Skill Type**: Opening Skill
* **Activation Rate**: 100.0%
* **Effective Range**: 3

When 2 of our heroes deal damage with active skills, 10%-20% of the damage dealt is used to restore the troops of our hero with the most wounded troops.

### **Title Advancement:**
* **Advancement I**: The chance for the innate skill to trigger Intellect damage is increased by 10%.
* **Advancement II**: The chance for the innate skill to trigger Intellect damage is increased by 10%, and the additional effect can be triggered when troops first fall below 80%.

### **Hero Positioning:**
* Powerful support for active skill systems.

### **Overall Character Evaluation:**
* **Mechanism Analysis**: An opening skill that covers all 8 rounds. It triggers based on the attempt to activate an active skill. When a hero's health is below a certain threshold, it can trigger twice, giving it an extremely exaggerated potential. At the same time, Joan of Arc can make another attempt, meaning that in coordination with Zhu Yuanzhang, it can trigger twice as well.
* **System Synergy**: Best paired with Joan of Arc's active skill system.
* **Dismantle Skill Analysis**: Provides some recovery when paired with active skill systems, suitable for Joan of Arc's active skill system.
