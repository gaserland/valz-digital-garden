Pioneers, the naval combat gameplay will officially launch in the Fourth Age. Today, we bring you the introduction to the naval combat rules for the Fourth Age, "Raging Tides," to help all Pioneers set sail and break the waves in the new era.

Note: The following effects are subject to the final version in-game.

### Sea Area Connectivity

#### 1. Regarding Movement and Connectivity

When a Pioneer's unit is in a sea area, it can move within that area. The following rules must be observed during movement:

(1) An ocean tile and an adjacent ocean tile are considered connected and can be traversed directly if there are no obstructions.

(2) An ocean tile and an adjacent land tile are considered disconnected and obstructed, and cannot be traversed. Exceptions are special tiles used for entering or leaving the sea, such as wharves or port cities.

(3) If a land tile adjacent to an ocean tile is a port city, Pioneers can issue an attack command to it from any location in the sea area. In this case, the two tiles are considered connected.

#### 2. Regarding the Conversion of Units Between Land and Sea

(1) Units can switch their state between land and sea by passing through structures such as wharves, passes, and port cities.

(2) A single unit can only be in either a sea or land state at one time; it cannot be both a naval and a land army simultaneously.

(3) Pioneers can switch between land and sea states via structures like wharves and port cities that connect land and sea.

### Naval Units

(1) Naval units are created when land army units are converted by "entering the sea" through structures like wharves and port cities.

(2) Unlike air units, a naval unit is not a separate troop type. Instead, the entire team must select a type of vessel.

(3) During the process of a land army entering the sea, a vessel type must be selected. The corresponding characteristics of the naval unit are then generated based on the vessel type chosen by the Pioneer, including world map attributes, combat attributes, etc. For specifics, please refer to the subsequent vessel unit rule descriptions.

(4) Pioneers can select the vessel type to be used by a team when it enters the sea in the team interface. Since it is not considered a troop type, it can be changed even when not in the main city. However, it can only be changed while on land or within a structure; the vessel type cannot be switched while moving at sea.

### Naval Combat Rules

#### 1. Combat Rules Between Naval Units

(1) When a naval unit collides with (occupies the same tile as) a hostile naval unit that is not in a truce state, combat will occur, similar to what happens in land areas.

![SS4 Server จีน - Fourth Age Preview - Naval Combat Gameplay Rules Connection, Conversion, Combat!-1755962937280.webp](/img/user/_attachments/SS4%20Server%20%E0%B8%88%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%99%20-%20Fourth%20Age%20Preview%20-%20Naval%20Combat%20Gameplay%20Rules%20Connection,%20Conversion,%20Combat!-1755962937280.webp)

(2) Naval units cannot engage in combat with units stationed on land, even if they are adjacent.

(3) Naval units can execute a "Garrison" command on any sea tile. When garrisoning at sea, the unit will defend all adjacent ocean tiles. The coastline is part of the ocean tiles and can be defended by garrisoning, but vessels cannot move onto coastline tiles.

#### 2. Rules for Combat Between Naval Units and Coastal Structures

(1) Some coastal structures exist partially at sea and partially on land, such as wharves and port cities. Pioneers can launch an attack on these structures from the sea. When attacking from the sea, the naval team will engage with the teams inside the city. The combat rules are consistent with land combat rules.

(2) When a naval team is victorious in combat against the defenders of a coastal structure and enters the siege state, the Pioneer's unit will be displayed as attached to the city wall, similar to attacking a city from land, but it will still be considered as occupying a sea area tile.

The above are the rules related to naval combat gameplay. We hope this helps Pioneers get started more quickly and become veteran sea captains of the Fourth Age soon.
