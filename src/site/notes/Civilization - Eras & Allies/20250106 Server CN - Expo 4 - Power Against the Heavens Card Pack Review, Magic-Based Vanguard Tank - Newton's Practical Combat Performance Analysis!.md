## Card Pack Main Hero Lineup Synergies
### (1) **Newton** [Simplified: 牛顿 / Traditional: 牛頓]
As a vanguard hero, his strengths are as follows:
1. His inherent skill deals damage whenever the entire team receives healing. Compared to traditional counterattack vanguards, his damage output no longer solely relies on the frequency of enemy normal attacks, ensuring a baseline for his damage output.
2. He is a magic-based hero with high enough Intelligence. Compared to most current defensive vanguards, he can withstand more magic-based damage.
3. He has good damage when paired with the new Brilliant Skill of the current version, **Protective True Word** [Simplified: 护身真言 / Traditional: 護身真言].

**Recommended Lineup One**:

![20250106 Server CN - Expo 4 - Power Against the Heavens Card Pack Review, Magic-Based Vanguard Tank - Newton's Practical Combat Performance Analysis!-1757917569435.webp](/img/user/_attachments/20250106%20Server%20CN%20-%20Expo%204%20-%20Power%20Against%20the%20Heavens%20Card%20Pack%20Review,%20Magic-Based%20Vanguard%20Tank%20-%20Newton's%20Practical%20Combat%20Performance%20Analysis!-1757917569435.webp)

From the battle report below, it can be seen that this team's tankiness and damage output are both quite exaggerated. It has a relatively obvious counter effect against teams like the Great Qin system or pursuit burst systems.

**Recommended Lineup Two**:

![20250106 Server CN - Expo 4 - Power Against the Heavens Card Pack Review, Magic-Based Vanguard Tank - Newton's Practical Combat Performance Analysis!-1757917667296.webp](/img/user/_attachments/20250106%20Server%20CN%20-%20Expo%204%20-%20Power%20Against%20the%20Heavens%20Card%20Pack%20Review,%20Magic-Based%20Vanguard%20Tank%20-%20Newton's%20Practical%20Combat%20Performance%20Analysis!-1757917667296.webp)

From the battle report below, it can be seen that **Newton** [Simplified: 牛顿 / Traditional: 牛頓] possesses both damage output and tankiness, and is particularly effective at countering the Great Qin burst system.

![20250106 Server CN - Expo 4 - Power Against the Heavens Card Pack Review, Magic-Based Vanguard Tank - Newton's Practical Combat Performance Analysis!-1757917691832.webp](/img/user/_attachments/20250106%20Server%20CN%20-%20Expo%204%20-%20Power%20Against%20the%20Heavens%20Card%20Pack%20Review,%20Magic-Based%20Vanguard%20Tank%20-%20Newton's%20Practical%20Combat%20Performance%20Analysis!-1757917691832.webp)

### (2) **Gilgamesh** [Simplified: 吉尔伽美什 / Traditional: 吉爾伽美什]
As a damage-dealing hero, his strengths are as follows:
1. His inherent skill has a high activation rate, providing a group Intelligence pursuit attack + damage amplification. The inherent skill's activation rate will decay after activating.
2. Needs to be paired with skills that can trigger normal attacks multiple times to ensure he can consistently deal pursuit damage.
3. With the addition of **Blade-Breaking Assault** [Simplified: 破刃强袭 / Traditional: 破刃強襲] in the new version, his damage ceiling has been significantly raised.

**Recommended Lineup One**:
