Having experienced the severe trials of the first four eras, the Pioneers seem to have grasped certain patterns of battlefield evolution. However... when it comes to strategy, the battlefield is never static, and tactical deployments need to break from the conventional. With the arrival of the Infinite Era "Mecha Frenzy", the all-new unit types—"Mecha" and "Doomsday Mecha"—will make a shocking debut. A subversive revolution is brewing; the rules and the entire landscape will be rewritten in a torrent of steel!

So what special "abilities" do they possess?
As two brand-new cavalry units, the **Mecha** [Simplified: 机甲 / Traditional: 機甲] and **Doomsday Mecha** [Simplified: 末日机甲 / Traditional: 末日機甲] possess the powerful ability of **Leap** [Simplified: 跃迁 / Traditional: 躍遷], allowing them to ignore the obstruction of passes and mountains within a traversable tile range, leaping over them. When the enemy relies on terrain advantages to stubbornly defend, Mechas can descend from the sky, leaping behind the enemy to catch them off guard, achieving the tactical effect of raiding and destroying the enemy's key targets.
